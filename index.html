			<p>Seven (stylized as SE7EN) is a 1995 American neo-noir[3] psychological crime thriller film directed by David Fincher and
			written by Andrew Kevin Walker. It stars Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, R. Lee Ermey and John
			C. McGinley. The film tells the story of David Mills (Pitt), a detective who partners with the retiring William Somerset
			(Freeman) to track down a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as a motif in his murders. The screenplay was
			influenced by the time Walker spent in New York City trying to make it as a writer. Principal photography took place in
			Los Angeles, with the last scene filmed near Lancaster, California. The film's budget was $33 million. Released on
			September 22, 1995 by New Line Cinema, Seven was the seventh-highest-grossing film of the year, grossing over $327
			million worldwide.[2] It was well received by critics and was nominated for Best Film Editing at the 68th Academy
			Awards, losing to Apollo 13.
